     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'sort'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it. Input data files, if any
     are named in the test code header, are in the 'data' sub-directory.

     The following list specifies the input for standard tests, whose
     output is appended to the test source code as a comment.
