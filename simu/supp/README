     The functions 'lrana,c' and 'lranb.c' are c-code versions of
     congruential generators that perform arithmetic modulo the
     prime number 2^31 -1. The assembly code '.s' source modules
     in the 'simu' directory should be replaced by this C code
     when the installation target is a non-Intel platform.

     The '.asm' modules are an alternative for 80x86 platforms
     that can be assembled with the 'nasm' assembler. This
     assembler employs an Intel type code format, rather than
     the odd AT&T format employed by GNU C.\
