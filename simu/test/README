     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'simu'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it. Input data files, if any
     are named in the test code header, are in the 'data' sub-directory.

     The 'timing' subdirectory contains code to time the execution of
     the pseudorandom generators in this library segment. Input to
     the timing functions is a sample size.

     The 'distribution' subdirectory contains code used to compute
     and tabulate the distribution of values produced by the normal
     and uniform ranom generators. Input to the distribution functions
     is a random seed and a sample size.

     The command line input parameters for each of the standard tests
     are specified in the following list. These inputs should reproduce
     the results appended as a comment to the test source code.

     tbran2  ef7bdb3 12 240000
     tlran1  3da1c1b8 25

     tunfl   378f3e50 20
     tunfl2  f53814d1 20

     These arguments specify a random seeds and sample sizes
     for the tests.
