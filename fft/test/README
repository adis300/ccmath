     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'fft'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it. Input data files, if any
     are named in the test code header, are in the 'data' sub-directory.

     Only the following three tests require command line inputs:

     t2dfft  3  0
     tpfac  63  120  175
     tsmoo  2  data/smoo.dat
