     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'roots'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it. Input data files, if any
     are named in the test code header, are in the 'data' sub-directory.

     The subdirectory 'op-test' contains code that supports a
     supplementary set of tests of the 'optmiz.c' software with various
     test functions.
