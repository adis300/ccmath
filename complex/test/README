     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'complex'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it. Input data files, if any
     are named in the test code header, are in the 'data' sub-directory.

     The correspondence between test programs and data input files
     is indicated below.

     tchypb   data/chypb.dat
     tclog    data/clog.dat
