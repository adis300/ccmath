     This directory contains test code for the functions of the 'intg'
     segment of the CCM math library. Each test code file has a sample
     of the correct output appended to it.

     No input parameters are required for the standard tests,
     however, two tests accept an optional command line parameter.

        tchintg n  (n = optional fit order)
        tfintg t   (t = optional convergence threshold)
