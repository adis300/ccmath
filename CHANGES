version 2.2.1 -- 11/8/01

     Alter the QR rotation routines supporting singular value
     decomposition qrbdv.c, qrbdu1.c, and qrbdi.c to avoid a
     rare numerical instability.

     Modify the installation script makelibs.sh to ensure that
     the new QR rotation code is not compiled with optimization.
     The QR fix does not survive the GNU compiler's optimization.

     Alter include in sany.c to read: #include "../ccmath.h".


version 2.2.0 -- 12/13/00

     Convert all function definitions to the modern ASCII style.

     Revise test programs to support automatic checking of their
     output against the sample output appended as a comment to
     the test code source. Modifications were made to most of
     the test code to support this.

     Supply shell code to permit the automatic checks of standard
     test outputs.

     Corect the manual entry for the values returned by the
     solv function (revision in C-01).


version 2.1.2 -- 10/05/00

     Modify installation scripts makelibs.sh and install.sh
     to eliminate an undefined linker option.

     Correct structure initializations in ccmath.h. (missing
     braces)

     Use <stdlib.h> to define all references to allocation
     functions calloc() and malloc(). This header is now
     included by ccmath.h.

     Correct failures to free allocated storage in some eigenvalue
     routines.

     Change declarations of unsigned long to unsigned int
     to correct problems on the DEC Alpha where unsigned long
     has a length of 64 bits.

     Revise ccmath.h and manual to reflect the altered
     declarations of unsigned quantities. (Revisions in
     C-07, C-10, and C-14.)

     Fixed a bug in the singular value distribution code
     that could lead to an attempt to operate with NANs. 


version 2.1.1 -- 5/19/00

     Revise hash storage programs to allow use of multiple
     hash schemes in a program. ( Programs that use the
     functions hashins, hashdel, hfind, and hval must be
     revised to use this new form.)

     Revised manual chapter C10-sort to reflect hash function
     changes.

     Minor correction in manual chapter C01-matrix.

     Clean up anachronistic K&R type declarations of calloc
     and malloc. (stdlib.h is now used)

     Alter index incrementation code in time series functions
     that resulted in warnings from DEC ALPHA compiler.


version 2.1.0 -- 5/1/00

     Add section containing benchmark test code and output.
     ('benchmk' directory )

     Specify use of '/bin/sh' in installation scripts

     Change license policy to LPGL the GNU library public license.
     


version 2.0.1 --  2/27/00 

     Correct spelling error in script 'install.sh'.

     3/19/00
     Correct function name in '~/simu/supp/lranb.c' :  "lrana() -> lranb()".
